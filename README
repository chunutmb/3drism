    3drism_thr    thread version (icc)
    pot           regular version (gcc)
    pot_mpi       MPI version
  among others

2. This directory are under the version control system git
   see the [Git Tips] section for details

3. To beautify a source code, type
    uncrustify -c uncrustify.cfg jh_get.c
   A copy of the program uncrustify is saved on /Bossman/cz1/app/bin/

4. Conversion between the old .jh3d format and the new .bin3d format
   is done by the program `bincvt'.  The lazy usage is as follows
    bincvt -l    # convert *.jh3d to .bin3d
   and
    bincvt -L    # convert *.bin3d to .jh3d
